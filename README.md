Description:
The project idea is to offer a Restaurant Recommendation and Reservation System. It is a platform for people who love to eat. The system will take the user's food preferences into account, which will then suggest good restaurants in the nearby area to the user. This recommendation will solely be based on the cost, the quality of the meal, customer reviews or ratings, accessibility, etc. The user can reserve a table after choosing the restaurant. The Reservation System offers features like booking a table at a specific restaurant, canceling the reservation, etc. The purpose of this system is to let people get ideas about which restaurant will be great for them. This system can give people some suggestions; also you can get others' opinions from this site. Besides viewing others' opinions, you can give suggestions to other people by rating restaurants. In this system, there are many ways to search restaurants, including by zip code, dish type, budget, dish name, Restaurant type, price, and by recommendation search.

Motivation:
Being international students, we have a hard time finding a decent restaurant that is both within our budget and conveniently located. As a result, we had the idea to build a system where users could check out a restaurant's menu and other details and reserve a table. Making a recommendation system will help users find a good restaurant within their budget.

Scope:
The user can browse through the restaurants and view the reviews. They can post reviews for the restaurant after logging in or signing up for the system. The project offers two primary features. The recommendation module comes first, followed by the reservation module. The project's scope is limited to just the eateries in Boston City. The recommendation module will be able to respond to a variety of user inquiries, like "A decent restaurant serving Burgers", The reservation module offers a variety of features, including the ability to reserve a table at a restaurant, cancel a reservation, or check for review for any restaurant.
